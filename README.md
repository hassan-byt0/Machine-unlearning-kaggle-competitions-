Machine Unlearning Approaches Documentation

In the pursuit of developing robust and flexible machine learning models, the ability to unlearn or adapt to changing data is essential. Here, we present three distinct approaches for machine unlearning, each offering a unique strategy for adjusting models in the face of evolving requirements. These approaches are refered from research papers.


Approach 1: Student-Teacher Model

Overview:

This approach is grounded in a student-teacher framework, aiming to selectively remove undesired information. The method involves training two neural networks as teachers — one competent and one incompetent — along with a neural network acting as a student. The competent teacher is trained on the entire dataset, while the incompetent teacher is initialized randomly. The student begins with parameters inherited from the competent teacher and is then trained to mimic both teachers simultaneously. The training process employs a loss function based on KL-divergence, evaluating the similarities between the student and each teacher. Notably, the competent teacher handles retained data, while the incompetent teacher addresses forgotten data.

Implementation:

Train a competent teacher on the complete dataset.

Initialize an incompetent teacher with random parameters.

Initialize a student with the competent teacher's model parameters.

Train the student to mimic both teachers using KL-divergence-based loss.

The competent teacher processes retained data, and the incompetent teacher manages forgotten data.


Approach 2: Linear Filtration for Logit-Based Classifiers

Overview:

This approach is tailored for logit-based classifiers, specifically softmax and logistic regression types. It functions effectively when the model utilizes softmax as the classification head, making it suitable for class removal scenarios.

Implementation:

Apply linear filtration to logit-based classifiers.

Specifically useful for softmax and logistic regression classifiers.

Applicable for unlearning scenarios involving class removal.


Approach 3: Noise Maximization Minimization Using Data Augmentation

Overview:

Proposed by Tarun et al., this approach focuses on unlearning for class removal through noise introduction using data augmentation. The core idea is to inject noise into the model to maximize classification errors for the target class(es). The model is then updated by training on this noisy data without requiring access to actual samples of the target class(es). To counter potential disruptions to model weights and classification performance for remaining classes, a repair step is introduced. This step involves training the model for additional epochs on the remaining data.

Implementation:

Introduce noise into the model to maximize classification errors for target class(es).

Update the model by training on the noisy data.

Implement a repair step to mitigate potential disruptions in model weights and classification performance.

Suitable for large-scale multi-class problems and demonstrated efficacy, particularly in face recognition tasks.

These three approaches offer diverse strategies for machine unlearning, catering to different scenarios and model architectures. The choice of approach depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the unlearning task at hand.
